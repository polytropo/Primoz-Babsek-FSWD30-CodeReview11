This is Rent A Car project that shows my knowledge of CRUD with mysql and PHP and a little of bootstrap. 
It has secure registration and login form.
Once user logs in they see ther dashboard where they can change their personal info, log out and display past orders they have made.
Only if the user is logged in he/she can see the menu at the top. 
Logged user can see cars that the renting company has and if available it will show book now button,
otherwise it will show when the car will be available.
THere is also a filter to apply cars available on specific of 4 locations.
And google API to sho locations of offices.
